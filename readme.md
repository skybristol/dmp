# Data Management Plans as code

This set of Jupyter Notebooks are an experimental way of writing data management plans as code instead of a set of static documents. They are meant to be living documents containing stuff to read about how data management is done for some given database or system but also live views into the data management process, tests of how things are going in that process, and notes about findings encountered over time. By leveraging a GitHub repository, we can maintain versions of these living documents over time as a record of progress in the data management practice.

We're still working out the details for how this is all done, so please get in touch if you are interested.
